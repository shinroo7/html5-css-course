/* Last Rule And Specificity */
/* When there is reprtitive elements, css takes the last one (execute the colour crimson). Need to be careful. */
p {
    color: blue;
}

p {
    color: crimson;
}

/* When adding the class to the paragraph (i.e. <p class = red >), then even css last rule doesn't apply. The paragraph text stays red. [.red { color:red }  p { color:blue }]  */
/* Can google CSS Specificity measurement */


/* Universal Selector */
/*  Use * to represent all */
/*     * { color:blue }      */
/* But the universal selector's hierarchy is the lowest */
